# NOTE

## THIS SOFTWARE WAS MADE AS A PASSION PROJECT. I DO NOT CONDONE USING THIS SOFTWARE ON ANYONE YOU DO NOT KNOW IN REAL LIFE.

# Doxx Yourself Button

A not so harmless button that will prompt you to press it. If you press it, it will grab some of your computers information and post it to a discord server via webhook. 
It grabs your IP, IP location, open ports, Steam games, If you have genshin installed, If you're using a proxy, A VPN, Tor, Device name, OS, Mac Address and CPU.

# How To Use

Replace line 95's variable with your discord webhook link. If you do not know how to make a webhook then follow the link that is listed as the variable. 

Then create an account using the link listed in line 96 and input the API key you are given by ipify.

This is enough to make the program work but I suggest turning it into an exe file via pyinstaller

# Upcoming features
Less lag when running the program. There are a ton of ports that dont really need to be checked which is causing the program to lag.
